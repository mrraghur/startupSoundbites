"We're in stealth mode" —> we haven't validated this yet and we have no idea how to make money from it.



"We're going upmarket." We haven't nailed the ICP yet, so we decided to hunt whales in the hopes that it will pay the bills. 
ideal customer profile (ICP) 


“We’re pre-revenue by choice.” —> We haven’t figured out how to monetize yet.

“We’re in stealth mode.” —> We don’t have a product or customers yet.

“We’re pivoting to focus on what really matters.” —> Our original idea failed, and now we're scrambling for something that works.

“We’re backed by top-tier investors.” —> We got a small check from an angel investor who once interned at a top VC firm.

“We’re solving a huge problem.” —> We’re still trying to figure out what problem we’re actually solving.

“We’ve been approached by several investors.” —> We sent out a bunch of cold emails, and one VC responded with ‘keep in touch.’



we do not have budget for marketing now but you can join us now and we will give you stocks, shares, bonus, a kidney..... -> we just BS you so you join us now, we are actually desperate. 🤡 

 "We have a disruptive business model." —> We're not making any money yet.

"We prioritize customer feedback"--> The truth is that we listen to it, but if it doesn’t fit our narrative, we pretend it never happened.

These are the kinds of posts I enjoy most on LinkedIn. They make you pause and reflect on what people are truly trying to convey when they make these kinds of statements.


“We pivoted after discovering a better opportunity” —> initial idea for the product tanked, but we are hopeful that we didn’t waste so much money on building something for nothing that we are now using the spaghetti strategy, which is to throw the product against whatever we can find and hopefully something will stick (spaghetti against the wall and go with the noodle that sticks)



We had an exit. —> it was a fire sale to escape bankruptcy



"We closed a first tranche of 500k and will close 5M next month" = after meeting with 100 VCs, we only could convince business angels and had to take the money to avoid bankrupcy



Our product is revolutionary" (while it's a slight improvement on an existing product).



"We have pivoted based on market feedback." —> Our original idea failed, so we are desperately trying something else.
“Our brand is synonymous with quality.” —> We spent more on our logo than on product development.
“Our customer satisfaction rate is over 90%.” —> We only survey our happiest customers.
“We have a strong social media presence.” —> We buy followers and likes to look popular.



"We are employee owned" --> We can't afford to offer our employees market rate wages and are operating on hopes and dreams.

1. “We’re focused on user acquisition right now.” —> We’re giving our product away for free because no one will pay for it.

2. “We’re data-driven.” —> We make decisions based on gut feelings and hope for the best.

3. “Our MVP is almost ready for launch.” —> Our prototype is a PowerPoint deck and a lot of enthusiasm.


Would add: 'Our product is in beta with a select group of users.' (Are the users in the room with us right now? 😂) 
Translation: —> We’ve handed out a few trial accounts to friends and family, they aren't really using it but they sent us a text telling us how proud they are. 

It’s easy to dress things up to look more impressive, but its rare to find founders who stay grounded and transparent. The real challenge is facing the truth about where you stand and making genuine progress. Never hurts to solicit outside help either. 



**You forgot "Harvard MBA" -----> Online course!
**
**Forbes 30 under 30 -> I'm on my way to jail
**


Read: we have no respect for work life balance and expect our team to be available 24/7 


We're bootstrapping all the way because we don't want to give up any equity ---> Investors have no interest in us because we have zero traction


We’re a 6 figure business = we once made $274 in a day and have multiplied that by 365 to claim a 6 figure run rate



"We are in Stealth Mode" —> We want to be founder so we are creating a problem because possible solutions of existing problems have been created.



“They love our model” - translation: Founders’ initial idea of the business never evolved. No vision for monetization, investment or GTM at scale.

We’re entering a new market because our product will gain a lot of traction there —> We are struggling to acquire customers in our existing market(s)


One of our founders is a serial entrepreneur => none of his ventures were successful enough, he wasn't even as invested in the businesses as he should have been, but he has a lot of money to spare 🙊




"This idea will disrupt the entire industry" -> You give us your money, we will figure it out later that either we will finish the industry or our poverty...😂

"The Founders should be the face of their brand to make content" -> We, the founders don't have enough money to afford models for shoots.




"We have an enterprise level SaaS" 

=

We have an MVP held together by spit and scotch tape. You can log in, but *please* don't do try to make it do anything useful.





"We're gonna reveal the product with a campaign that's guaranteed to go viral" -> We have something so cringe or out of date planned that we're immediately irrelevant.





I would add: "I built a tool that helps you grow on linkedin" --> "I don't care about authentic engagement, so I'm going to build a tool that allows me to hack engagement and sell that to other poor souls who desperately want to validate their existence through vanity metrics and turn LinkedIn into one gigantic automated engagement pod farm" 




"Our projections value the equity we're offering you to be $10 Billion dollars when we go public in 2 years" —> I'm living in dreamland, don't have PMF, my churn is 10x my acquisition and I can't afford to pay what you're worth.





"We successfully exited our last startup" -> We had to wind down the company and return what was left of the investors' money. Our 'exit' was just getting our salaries paid.

”We're pre-revenue but have a strong user base.”—> We have 50 users, 45 of whom are friends and family.



“Our company uses AI to disrupt the X industry.” 

Translation: We used one open source AI model so we can say we have AI so we can get to the front of the line in the fundraising conversations.



additionally "We've growing 100% month-over-month"  --> we had $1,000 ARR and not we have $2,000




"We need to reorganize the structure." -> "We run out of our budget so we need to layoff you guys and replace it with the cheaper one."


"We are fully compliant with all the applicable laws" _> we are still figuring out which laws are applicable and will complete paper work during dilgence!


"We are working on launching a product similar to Facebook in 2 months" —>We have no idea of what kind of product this is going to be and no roadmap for launch.



"We're visionaries with a track record for success." -> We were having beers one night and thought we could make money from this.



"We work with Microsoft, Google, General Electric, Disney" --> emails from these companies are on our mailing list, and a guy working for Disney is using the free trial right now

'we're about to close our round' - we've sent our deck to a couple of investors but no one has replied yet





We are a tech-driven or tech-first company --> some of our data is in excel sheets.





“few industry experts agreed to have coffee with us once.” Should add “for options worth 10% of the company.”





„We are venture backed and on our way to profitability“ —> Our EBIT margin is minus 100%, ie our cost is twice as high as our revenues



“It’s on our road map.”
We don’t do that but have heard about it enough times to realize that we probably should - not that we’ve taken any steps to actually execute on delivery. 😀




"We are hiring" —> We want everyone to think that we're a fast-growing company.





"We are aggressively hiring" -> "A lot of people are leaving because the internal culture is crap"





“Our staff are extremely loyal” —> no one else thinks we have talents worth attracting 🤭

Or —> we are over-paying them 😅





“We’re raising another round at the same ARR as last time due to streamlining our product offerings”

—-> we are still figuring out what our product is, give us lots of runway for as little % of my company as possible






"We took a successful exit" --> We lost vision and couldn't see profitability so we put it on someone else to burn their money and time





"Our founders have very niche experience for us to bootstrap this" - founders work full-time jobs and barely have time to focus on this business





"We've worked with Apple, Samsung, and all the other tech giants in the space" --> You had an intro call and haven't even completed a project together.



Instead of cash salary, we will give ESOPs. You will make tons of money in few years through ESOP -> You will end up working for peanuts and ESOPs wont be cashable.

“Money doesn’t matter “ -> we don’t have any


"Our team will verify this situation." Said the CEO of a start-up with zero employees and one or two contractors. 




We have a fantastic diversity policy -> we have a policy but we don't have any diversity in the management team





« We don’t need Investors anymore » —> we raised a lot of money but still looking to make money



“We’re solving a real problem.” —> We came up with a problem that justifies our product’s existence.





„We’re currently not fundraising. Instead, we’re in the trenches building a great company“ —> Our product and revenue are a catastrophe, nobody would even consider giving us a penny




‘We’re the Uber of [insert industry]’ —> We don’t have a unique idea, just a catchy tagline.” 




We make sure our employees really enjoy and have a healthy work environment - as long as they do not complain, don’t ask for a raise and do not want to do any trainings or other things we need to invest in.



From my perspective: “We have already built strong relationships with tier 1 media” -> We were once quoted briefly in TechCrunch



"We have an unlimited leave policy" -> I decide when you come and go and I hope you never ask.




“We’re using cutting-edge AI / machine learning” —> We analyze data in Excel

"Our customer churn is low." → We only had 10 customers to start with, so losing 2 of them doesn’t seem too bad.

“We have several solid LOIs in place!” —> no one is willing to to pay us for anything and 3 of them are my friends..

"We're the largest player in the entire country" -> We're the only player operating in a hyper specific niche

"We're seeing strong traction in the market." => My friends and family finally signed up.

I work 80 hours a week because I'm so passionate about my startup —> I haven't had a weekend off in months and my social life is non-existent, but at least I have my startup to keep me company.

"Our product is under testing with 5 design partners to deliver an MVP."--> Dad, Mum, Sister, Best Friend and Dog become design partners.

"Our TAM is X billion." We have no idea what our target market is. 


**If we capture 0,75% of the niche market, our ARR will be $ 750 Million in just three years.

We are the next unicorn.

**“Our customers keep coming back to us”. 


“They’ve been following up for months on the one small issue they wanted us to fix. “

“We only hire A players” -> my best friends from college make up my leadership team.



Our team has 100 yrs of experience in … (and we have counted our kindergarten time twice…)



We’re pivoting to new opportunities —> Our original idea flopped, so we’re scrambling to find something that sticks.

* We have 10x growth = 1 x 10 (descriptive numbers)
* The disruptive and revolutionary words but have no demand generation plan and dependent on paid ads

* 
“We just shipped our most requested feature” —> One user requested the feature saying they would upgrade if we have it.




We’re scaling rapidly! - We’ve had a few viral posts, but our actual user growth is more of a trickle. 😂

'Sign up to know more about product that could skyrocket your revenue'-Landing page validation




"We offer flexible work hours and remote work" --> You need to come to the office at least 3 days per week and the only flexibility that you'll receive is flexibility when you *don't* work. 



"The TAM is $200B, so if 1% buys our solution, that's $2B" -> The market is $50M in North America and we only sell locally




"We're making the world a better place through.." --> We're not, but we loved the joke on Silicon Valley



"we are sure we will capture 10% of this $20 Billion TAM, the opportunity is huge

----> we do not know how to estimate our market , we haven't cracked our ICP and haven't decided the pricing




"We’re moving fast and breaking things." → We’re rushing and making a lot of mistakes.





“Our onboarding is fully customised” —> we’re putting your info in an Google Sheey manually

"We are diversity first" - All management white from same biz school 🤣 



“Our product has amazing customer reviews.” —> We asked our friends and family to leave us 5-star reviews.



We have strong c-level executive team -> Marketing team consist of only the "CMO"



"We're hiring" -> We're threw out a job posting and are lowballing every single candidate to see if we can find a desperate soul that will take it. We want top talent but can't really afford it

✨
“As featured in [Bloomberg|Tech Crunch|Local Paper]”

We’ve spent more time trying to get publicity than selling to customers and earning revenue.



Another banger: "We're closing this round soon." -> We're still looking for our first cheque. 


I’d add: “We’re getting a lot of inbound interest from VCs.” —> We sent out a thousand cold emails, and a couple of them replied.



"We use chatGPT and have a nice UI" 90% of "AI" startups.



Flat organizational structures = you'll have your title (and most likely salary) until the exit

We smashed double digits growth YoY--> we achieved 07% growth


“We have AI” - we have people pretending to be the AI

20h
We don't need marketing, this is so good it will sell itself
