10 startup lies 👇

“Forbes 30 under 30” —> I paid a PR firm $50,000 so my mum could be proud of me

"We have a highly experienced advisory board." —> A few industry experts agreed to have coffee with us once.

“Our sales team is crushing it!” —> About 25% of our sales team hit quota

"We're in stealth mode" —> we haven't validated this yet and we have no idea how to make money from it.



"We're going upmarket." We haven't nailed the ICP yet, so we decided to hunt whales in the hopes that it will pay the bills. 
ideal customer profile (ICP) 


“We’re pre-revenue by choice.” —> We haven’t figured out how to monetize yet.

“We’re in stealth mode.” —> We don’t have a product or customers yet.

“We’re pivoting to focus on what really matters.” —> Our original idea failed, and now we're scrambling for something that works.

“We’re backed by top-tier investors.” —> We got a small check from an angel investor who once interned at a top VC firm.

“We’re solving a huge problem.” —> We’re still trying to figure out what problem we’re actually solving.

“We’ve been approached by several investors.” —> We sent out a bunch of cold emails, and one VC responded with ‘keep in touch.’



we do not have budget for marketing now but you can join us now and we will give you stocks, shares, bonus, a kidney..... -> we just BS you so you join us now, we are actually desperate. 🤡 

 "We have a disruptive business model." —> We're not making any money yet.

"We prioritize customer feedback"--> The truth is that we listen to it, but if it doesn’t fit our narrative, we pretend it never happened.

These are the kinds of posts I enjoy most on LinkedIn. They make you pause and reflect on what people are truly trying to convey when they make these kinds of statements.


“We pivoted after discovering a better opportunity” —> initial idea for the product tanked, but we are hopeful that we didn’t waste so much money on building something for nothing that we are now using the spaghetti strategy, which is to throw the product against whatever we can find and hopefully something will stick (spaghetti against the wall and go with the noodle that sticks)



We had an exit. —> it was a fire sale to escape bankruptcy



"We closed a first tranche of 500k and will close 5M next month" = after meeting with 100 VCs, we only could convince business angels and had to take the money to avoid bankrupcy



Our product is revolutionary" (while it's a slight improvement on an existing product).



"We have pivoted based on market feedback." —> Our original idea failed, so we are desperately trying something else.
“Our brand is synonymous with quality.” —> We spent more on our logo than on product development.
“Our customer satisfaction rate is over 90%.” —> We only survey our happiest customers.
“We have a strong social media presence.” —> We buy followers and likes to look popular.



"We are employee owned" --> We can't afford to offer our employees market rate wages and are operating on hopes and dreams.

1. “We’re focused on user acquisition right now.” —> We’re giving our product away for free because no one will pay for it.

2. “We’re data-driven.” —> We make decisions based on gut feelings and hope for the best.

3. “Our MVP is almost ready for launch.” —> Our prototype is a PowerPoint deck and a lot of enthusiasm.


Would add: 'Our product is in beta with a select group of users.' (Are the users in the room with us right now? 😂) 
Translation: —> We’ve handed out a few trial accounts to friends and family, they aren't really using it but they sent us a text telling us how proud they are. 

It’s easy to dress things up to look more impressive, but its rare to find founders who stay grounded and transparent. The real challenge is facing the truth about where you stand and making genuine progress. Never hurts to solicit outside help either. 



**You forgot "Harvard MBA" -----> Online course!
**
**Forbes 30 under 30 -> I'm on my way to jail
**


Read: we have no respect for work life balance and expect our team to be available 24/7 


We're bootstrapping all the way because we don't want to give up any equity ---> Investors have no interest in us because we have zero traction


We’re a 6 figure business = we once made $274 in a day and have multiplied that by 365 to claim a 6 figure run rate



"We are in Stealth Mode" —> We want to be founder so we are creating a problem because possible solutions of existing problems have been created.



“They love our model” - translation: Founders’ initial idea of the business never evolved. No vision for monetization, investment or GTM at scale.




“I am running 50k/month agency and I can teach you how to do it” - I plan to make 100k from hungry freelancers crowd.






“Our tech is built on cutting-edge blockchain technology.” —> We added ‘blockchain’ to our pitch deck to sound more innovative.

“We’re pre-revenue but have significant traction.” —> We have a lot of meetings, but no one’s paying us yet. 



"We are the marketplace for..." --> We are trying to convince vendors to sell through us.




We’re entering a new market because our product will gain a lot of traction there —> We are struggling to acquire customers in our existing market(s)


One of our founders is a serial entrepreneur => none of his ventures were successful enough, he wasn't even as invested in the businesses as he should have been, but he has a lot of money to spare 🙊




"This idea will disrupt the entire industry" -> You give us your money, we will figure it out later that either we will finish the industry or our poverty...😂

"The Founders should be the face of their brand to make content" -> We, the founders don't have enough money to afford models for shoots.




"We have an enterprise level SaaS" 

=

We have an MVP held together by spit and scotch tape. You can log in, but *please* don't do try to make it do anything useful.





"We're gonna reveal the product with a campaign that's guaranteed to go viral" -> We have something so cringe or out of date planned that we're immediately irrelevant.





I would add: "I built a tool that helps you grow on linkedin" --> "I don't care about authentic engagement, so I'm going to build a tool that allows me to hack engagement and sell that to other poor souls who desperately want to validate their existence through vanity metrics and turn LinkedIn into one gigantic automated engagement pod farm" 




"Our projections value the equity we're offering you to be $10 Billion dollars when we go public in 2 years" —> I'm living in dreamland, don't have PMF, my churn is 10x my acquisition and I can't afford to pay what you're worth.





"We successfully exited our last startup" -> We had to wind down the company and return what was left of the investors' money. Our 'exit' was just getting our salaries paid.



"Community is at the centre of our business" - We have a Telegram group where we spam our users.



"This is our vision for next 3 years --> we don't know if we can survive this year." ☠



"Our sales matched expectations" —> Sales are falling off a cliff and we need to lay everybody off.



'We’re laser-focused on our product roadmap.' —> We pivot every time we talk to a new investor. 




"We have a proprietary algorithm." —> We tweaked a Python script we found on papers with code.

"We're pursuing strategic partnerships." —> We're cold-emailing everyone on LinkedIn.




"We don't need marketing, it's so good it will sell itself" -> we don't have a marketing budget. 




”We're pre-revenue but have a strong user base.”—> We have 50 users, 45 of whom are friends and family.



“Our company uses AI to disrupt the X industry.” 

Translation: We used one open source AI model so we can say we have AI so we can get to the front of the line in the fundraising conversations.



additionally "We've growing 100% month-over-month"  --> we had $1,000 ARR and not we have $2,000




"We need to reorganize the structure." -> "We run out of our budget so we need to layoff you guys and replace it with the cheaper one."
