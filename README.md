"We're in stealth mode" —> we haven't validated this yet and we have no idea how to make money from it.



"We're going upmarket." We haven't nailed the ICP yet, so we decided to hunt whales in the hopes that it will pay the bills. 
ideal customer profile (ICP) 


“We’re pre-revenue by choice.” —> We haven’t figured out how to monetize yet.

we do not have budget for marketing now but you can join us now and we will give you stocks, shares, bonus, a kidney..... -> we just BS you so you join us now, we are actually desperate. 🤡 

 "We have a disruptive business model." —> We're not making any money yet.

"We prioritize customer feedback"--> The truth is that we listen to it, but if it doesn’t fit our narrative, we pretend it never happened.

These are the kinds of posts I enjoy most on LinkedIn. They make you pause and reflect on what people are truly trying to convey when they make these kinds of statements.


“We pivoted after discovering a better opportunity” —> initial idea for the product tanked, but we are hopeful that we didn’t waste so much money on building something for nothing that we are now using the spaghetti strategy, which is to throw the product against whatever we can find and hopefully something will stick (spaghetti against the wall and go with the noodle that sticks)



We had an exit. —> it was a fire sale to escape bankruptcy



"We closed a first tranche of 500k and will close 5M next month" = after meeting with 100 VCs, we only could convince business angels and had to take the money to avoid bankrupcy



Our product is revolutionary" (while it's a slight improvement on an existing product).



"We have pivoted based on market feedback." —> Our original idea failed, so we are desperately trying something else.
“Our brand is synonymous with quality.” —> We spent more on our logo than on product development.
“Our customer satisfaction rate is over 90%.” —> We only survey our happiest customers.
“We have a strong social media presence.” —> We buy followers and likes to look popular.



"We are employee owned" --> We can't afford to offer our employees market rate wages and are operating on hopes and dreams.
